    def removeElement(self, nums, val):

# NOTE: array.remove() will happen in-place!
# It will remove from left to right of given array
# In Python remove() will remove the first occurrence of value in a list.

"""
Example 1:

Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
